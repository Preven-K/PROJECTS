Password Generator
This repository contains the Python script for a dynamic password generator I developed as part of my virtual internship at CODSOFT. The password generator is designed to create secure and customizable passwords based on user preferences.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a versatile password generator that could accommodate different security requirements by incorporating letters, numbers, and special characters based on user input. This script ensures that the generated passwords not only meet the specified criteria but are also unpredictable and secure.

Features
Customizable Length: Users can specify the minimum length of the password.
Inclusion of Numbers: Users can choose to include or exclude numbers in the password.
Inclusion of Special Characters: Users can decide whether to include special characters.
Security-Driven Design: Ensures that the generated passwords are secure and meet the specified requirements.
